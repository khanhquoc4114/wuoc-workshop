# Threat Detection & Response Workshop

### Overall
This workshop provides a comprehensive journey from threat detection fundamentals to advanced incident response on AWS. You will explore multi-service integrations, custom orchestration workflows, and real-world remediation scenarios. By the end of this session, you will be equipped with the best practices and hands-on experience needed to operate securely and maintain a robust security posture on AWS.
